Quick introduction to JPA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JPA - Java Persistence API.
In JDBC, we write a query and map the parameters to it. And In reverse side, when we get results from database,
we map them back to beans.
Writing these complex queries is difficult for java developer.

That's where JPA comes in.

Why don't we map object/entity directly to row in a table?

In JPA, we define something called Entity and we define relationship between entities as well.

Once we define Entity and Relationships, JPA implementation will take care of identifying the entities and creating
 the right queries for you, based on operation you would want to perform.

 So the job of writing queries shifts from developer to a framework called JPA,

 JPA is like an interface. It defines a set of annotations and a set of interfaces.
 Hibernate is the most popular implementation of JPA.

 Hibernate implements JPA.

Hibernate is the most popular ORM framework, JPA came later.

JPA is the standard of doing Object Relation Mapping.
